# CANVAS: A Benchmark for Vision-Language Models on Tool-Based UI Design

This repository contains the source code for the [CANVAS project website](TBD).

## About CANVAS

CANVAS is the first benchmark to evaluate vision-language models' ability to perform tool-based UI generation in interactive, multi-turn design environments. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories.

## Key Features

- **598 tool-based design tasks** across replication and modification scenarios
- **3,327 UI designs** from 30 categories (onboarding, messaging, etc.)
- **50 Figma-integrated tools** for realistic design workflows
- **Multi-turn agentic evaluation** using ReAct framework
- **Comprehensive metrics** aligned with human preferences (75% prediction accuracy)
