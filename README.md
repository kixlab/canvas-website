# CANVAS: A Benchmark for Vision-Language Models on Tool-Based UI Design

This repository contains the source code for the [CANVAS project website](TBD).

## About CANVAS

CANVAS is the first benchmark to evaluate vision-language models' ability to perform tool-based UI generation in interactive, multi-turn design environments. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories.
